## Requirements to use BleemSync

* Windows, Mac or Linux is supported. (In theory chromeOS? (untested))
* Generic RDNIS driver (this should auto install for Windows and Linux. Mac driver can be found here)
  * note 1 – The PSC is disguised as a Samsung Galaxy (same as Hakchi) so it should easily install when connected.
  * note 2 – If you use Hakchi CE for the (S)NESC then you very likely have the RDNIS driver installed already. (It uses the same driver)
  * note 3 – If in doubt regarding the Windows RDNIS driver you can grab it here
* A half decent web browser. (Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera) (Internet Explorer is NOT supported!)
* A low powered USB drive. (Or any USB via a USB2.0 externally powered USB hub)
  * note 1 – As of 1.0 OTG support is not enabled. (YET) Because of this you are limited to 100ma on the front 2 USB ports.
  * note 2 – USB2.0 drives are recommended as they generally use less power than newer drives.
